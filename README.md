# Puppy Rescue

Author: Hridayesh

Design: This is an expedition game where you must rely on the sound from the terrain to reliably move around and to find the target.

How To Play:

You're camping and it's the middle of the night. You hear a pup wailing. You want to save to save the puppy, but then you also hear barking in the distance. It's the mama dog looking for her puppy.
You go out to look for the puppy, but then your flashlight dies, leaving you with no way to see in the dark.

Goal:
You are to save the puppy and bring it back to the mama dog before the mama finds you and kills you (and then make it back to camp :) )

The only sense you can rely on is sound. 
You'll be quiet when going through the grass and forest, but if you step on a twig, the mama dog will hear you and have your scent. The mama dog will speed up and go in your direction, but only for a few seconds. You can also lose her by going in water. You're much more likely to step on a twig in grass than you are in the forest. You'll hear the puppy wailing from a particular direction if you are close.

Controls: 
You won't be able to see anything, but use the arrow keys to move around. Respond to the sound in the game. 

Note, I think the game is slightly buggy, so some runs of the game may not work properly. 

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
